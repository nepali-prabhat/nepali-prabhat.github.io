My girlfriend saw a dream of her room burning. After waking up, she looked at the clutter around her room and thought
"What would I grab while running away from my burning room?"

This is where the inspiration for this post comes from.

However, I'm in the USA for now; away from my family; away from home.
I look around and there is nothing I'd take with me if this place was burning.
