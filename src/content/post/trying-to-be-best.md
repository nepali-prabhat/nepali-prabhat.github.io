“I am going to be the best at everything I do.” This is how I identify myself. I thought this was the right mentality to have. After all, who wants to be mediocre? So, I tried to be the best at literally _everything_ I did.

Recently, I challenged myself to draw and I realized how this mentality has been affecting me.

### My art journey

Art is something that I’ve been interested since my childhood but never actually tried. It started out good. I only had one goal in mind: consistency. I wanted to draw everyday irrespective of the results.

I have been drawing everyday for the last 21 days. I’m improving fast. If I keep improving at the same rate, I could be really good at art.

But since the last 5 days, my mindset has been shifting from “just drawing” to trying to be “the best”. It has only been holding me back. I discovered the reason it was not the right mindset to have was due to following reasons.

#### Small room for error

I am a dumb ass. I make mistakes. Its inevitable. But the mentality of being the best stops me from making mistakes. It makes me too concerned about the end result. This hinders me to concentrate on the process.

#### Increased expectation

Being the best means being at the same level as the greats. This has raised bar for my own work. A bar so high I can’t even reach. It gave birth to perfection. I disregarded so many of my drawings mid because it didn’t reach my expectation.

#### Search for perfect practice

“Give it your best shot,” says a coach to his players before slapping their asses and sending them to play. We see this in movies all the time. It is very motivating. But what if you are not at your best?

In order to give it my best shot, I started searching for perfect practice, the best books, the best tutorials and so on. The problem is that I wasn’t actually practicing. I wasted hours googling for perfect practice instead of actually practicing.

#### Being demotivated

If there is always going to be someone who is better than me, is it even worth trying? This question highlights what is fundamentally wrong with trying to be the best. Looking at others art gravely demotivated me.

I found out many creatives struggle with this. I’m still searching for the solution to this problem. But realization is a good first step. I’ve realized that I should forget about being the best to actually be the best. Kind of ironic.
