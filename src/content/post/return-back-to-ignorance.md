These are some observations that might or might not be clearly communicated.
It's easier to understand if you have ever pursued something seriously yourself.

The reason children are such great beginners is because they have limited awareness.
They don't have to wrestle with their inner critic.
They don't question how their pursuits fit in the world, or if it's even worth doing it.
Thus, they can easily fall in love with what they are doing.

In the art-making process, too much awareness works against you.
Being aware that a good painting is a combination of value, shape, edge, etc might help you better understand others artwork, or make you a good art critic. But it helps little in making *you* a good painter.

The best thing for a beginner is not to be aware of *all* the various things that makes something good. Rather, it's being comfortable and falling in love with the *actual* process.
This requires some form of ignorance. Ignorance of the end product, to the perceptions of the outside world, ignorance of what's good.
It's a lot easier to be proud of your work when you don't know all the different things you missed.

Creative ideas come from ignorance. The more aware you are, the harder it is to come up with something completely "out there". The more you understand the risks, the more difficult it is to be courageous.

## Return back to ignorance

A curious person falls into the temptation of reaching for information. There are lots of people who walked the same path you are currently on, and they share things they wish they did differently. There are some great tutorials, blog posts, and books that expose you to all kinds of information. All correct, valid information. But those are not for you.

These expose you to the scale of the mountain you are climbing. All the different paths you can take, all the people that are trying to reach the same goal, some that are climbing faster than you, some that failed, some that are already there.

***Please remain ignorant.***
Between awareness and ignorance, choose the later. Treat awareness as a luxury.

The fact is, you can't climb a mountain by noticing the scale of it. You climb it by taking steps; yourself. This requires very little awareness. Don't worry about it all. Just focus on what's directly in front of you. Other things are *meant to be* realized after multiple poor attempts.


When you find yourself being "too aware", return back to ignorance.
