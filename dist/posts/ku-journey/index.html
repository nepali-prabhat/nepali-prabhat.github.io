say this light-heartedly and often even find humor in it. But to me, this has started to become a reality.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I do remember what I learned and that will never go away. But some years back I noticed that I have no memories of my childhood days. I also don’t remember anything of my school life except some key moments. I am slowly forgetting my high school days as well.</p>
<p>Now with my graduation being over, I have decided that this time I am not going to forget my uni life. The memories I’ve made are too precious. So, like a good programmer, I will document it; the university I studied at, the hostel I stayed in, the things I learned, the events that happened, and most importantly the friends I made.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-1-university"><strong>Chapter 1: University</strong></h3>
<p>I studied bachelor’s in computer engineering at Kathmandu University. It’s located at 28 Kilo, Dhulikhel so I had to stay away from my home. I ended up staying at the Garden Hostel with my high school best friends, Karun and Bijay. The three of us shared a single room. It had 3 beds in three corners, a table in front of the only window, and a cloth hanger made of bamboo.</p>
<p>It was sort of a miracle how all three of us ended up together at that place. We have been best friends since our high school days at Trinity. After high school was over, everyone started preparing for university entrance exams. Some of our friends even started studying for the entrance exams since grade 12 had just started. But that wasn’t really our style. The three of us started only after the board exams were over.</p>
<p>With the popularity of engineering and medical courses, entrance preparation institutes were springing up like mushrooms. There was PEA, SEA, OCEAN, VIBRANT, NAME, NIMS, ORBIT, and probably a million more. All three of us wanted to join the same institute so we picked PEA. Looking back, we should have put more thought into which institute we were joining; or why we were joining one at all. But again, that wasn’t really our style. Everyone was choosing an institute and PEA was more popular among others. So, we just went with it. We joined the institute and bought a ton of entrance preparation books but studying the books was a completely different story.</p>
<p>I hated PEA. The classes would be filled with sweaty teenagers. As soon as you entered, a strong, thick air would knock on your nostrils and try to choke you to death. There would be way too many students and no place to sit. A late comer like me would always have to sit squeezed with 4 other students on a single bench. Bijay, Karun, and I got separated into different sections and the students in my sections probably hated having fun in life or something. No one tried to talk or make new friends. Everyone would sit in a serious mood; staring at the whiteboard as the teacher came and asked us to remember formulas and patterns for common questions that might appear in the exam. The whole thing was just so boring. On top of that, and also most importantly, there were no girls in my section. They say one has to go through hell to achieve something; this must be what they are talking about.</p>
<p>Karun still studied though. He is a stupidly dedicated person. Bijay and I tried to attend classes for one week, got bored, and stopped. We said we’d study at home. We did not. We’d call each other every day and ask if we were studying. We’d both say no. This gave us validation to not read. We avoided asking this question to Karun because if we asked him, he’d say that he was studying and that would make us depressed.</p>
<p>We had two major options for university. The first option was Tribhuvan University (TU) and the other was Kathmandu University (KU) All three of us knew we wanted to study computer engineering and the best option would be Pulchowk Engineering Campus affiliated with TU. Its fee was comparatively low and the best of the best students would go there. Karun was targeting that. Later, as the entrance dates came close, Bijay also got serious and started studying. He also targeted Pulchowk. Although Bijay looks like a thief, he is actually extremely ambitious and sets high standards for himself. He said that if he couldn’t get into Pulchowk, he’d apply for abroad studies.</p>
<p>I on the other hand was just sitting there with no particular goal for a college or even interest in studying engineering for that matter. While I was good at mathematics and physics, I wanted to study music and explore my creative side. But my family wouldn’t allow me to do that. So I rebelled and started self-sabotaging myself. As a result, I hadn’t read at all since my high school board exams.</p>
<p>After some months, the entrance came and went by. As expected, I scored embarrassingly poorly in the TU entrance. Bijay scored well but not enough to go to Pulchowk Campus. Karun scored better than Bijay but still not enough to go to Pulchowk Campus.</p>
<p>We had also given entrance exams in KU. I liked KU. I was attracted by its environment. There were many trees, water bodies, flowers, and well-trimmed bushes. A clean, fresh and cool air would flow that would rejuvenate your mind and body. Polar opposite from Kathmandu’s air that would just speed up your lung cancer if you took deep breaths for a while. I was also attracted to its infrastructure; big buildings, library, canteen, black top roads, fountain, football ground, basketball court and so on. Even the washrooms fascinated me; they had automatic flush systems! It just felt like a proper university.</p>
<p>Bijay was initially hesitant to even take the entrance exam of KU. For him, it was either Pulchowk or abroad. But because Karun and I were giving the exam, he did it as well. KU entrance exam was after TU’s. I had just butchered my entrance exam for TU so I felt bad. I studied for a total of 3 days before the KU entrance exam date. Karun and Bijay scored well in KU’s entrance. This time, I scored a bit better in its Computer Based Test (CBT). It was over 1000 which would, in past years, be enough to get enrolled in its computer engineering program.</p>
<p>After some weeks of the entrance exam, KU would publish a list of eligible candidates for admission. It was based on the score students got in their CBT. They would publish the list three times in total. Since Karun got the highest amongst us, his name was sure to appear one of those times. It appeared in the second list. Bijay got less than Karun but he still had a chance of having his name appear on the third list. At this point, Bijay had settled from Pulchowk to KU and was desperate. He would count the total number of published names, and the total number of quotas, make hypotheses on who would admit and who wouldn’t, and then estimate the probability of his name appearing in the third list. It did. As for me, I scored a little less than Bijay. My name didn’t appear on the third list. And there would be no fourth list. I got separated from Bijay and Karun.</p>
<p>In a normal year, if someone scored over 1000, they could easily get in. But it looked like everyone was extremely talented this year since my score of 1010 didn’t seem to be enough. I felt defeated and decided to enroll in Kathford college affiliated with TU. Its fee was high. I think it was around 9 lakhs. The college building sucked. It was right beside the highway in Balkumari and was between so much noise, dust, and smoke. What a downfall from KU’s environment! The admission fee itself was high. My parents struggled with the fee but they were somehow able to manage it.</p>
<p>On the day of admission, I was sensing a bad feeling from the very morning; as if someone was trying to tell me it was an unlucky day, something bad was going to happen. Dad and I went for the admission. I was feeling the same uneasy feeling as we were finalizing my admission. But we did it anyway; we paid a shit ton of money to a shitty college located in a shittier place. This would be my life for the next 4 years. After the admission, dad went to his work and I decided I’d walk my way home. I was a little hesitant to walk because of how I was feeling. Something bad was sure to happen; maybe I’ll get lost or someone kidnaps me or maybe a truck will hit me as I’m crossing the road and splatter my brain across the dark-pitched road.</p>
<p>As I had just begun to walk, Bijay called me and said that KU had published a notice regarding Expression of Interest (EOI). Candidates whose names didn’t appear in the previous lists but were interested in enrolment could submit EOI. A next list would appear with the names of EOI applicants who could then proceed to admission. It was kind of like the fourth list that I desperately wanted to be published.</p>
<p>This news was like the truck I feared would hit me and splatter my brains. I started overthinking the whole situation. I had just then been admitted to Kathford. How do I tell my dad I wanted to study at KU; that I’ve been presented with another opportunity? The admission fee was already so high and I am grateful that my parents are doing this for me. If I canceled my admission now, Kathford would probably not return the money. Besides, dad had already maintained a good relationship with the principal and dad is the type of person that gives and takes respect. Even if we could get the money back, his very nature would not allow him to cancel the admission. On the other hand, Bijay kept saying that this is my chance. He had already made hypotheses, estimated the probability, and everything. If I submit EOI, the next list would surely have my name. I could study in that beautiful place together with my best friends. My god! Such a dilemma. The whole walk home I was thinking about what I should do.</p>
<p>That night, I talked to my family about this. As expected, dad didn’t like it. Pragya didi said she’d try to persuade him. Mom couldn’t decide on either option. But one thing was for sure, she would easily give up the money if that’s what I wanted and it meant a better future for me. Although we would probably have to take more loans due to that decision.</p>
<p>The very next day, I submitted the EOI and was waiting for the new notice, desperately. This time I was the one making hypotheses and calculating probabilities. After a few days, a new notice appeared that had my name on it. We decided to make another admission in KU. As for the money paid to Kathford, they did return a portion of it but the rest was lost.</p>
<p>Finally, despite all the uncertainties, all three of us best friends enrolled in the same program at KU and started living under the same roof.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-2hostel">Chapter 2: Hostel</h3>
<p>Studying at KU would mean I would need to stay away from home which I had never done before. In fact, until high school, I hadn’t even been outside my community that much. I would be at my school or my home. I didn’t visit anywhere, play sports, or have any hobbies that I’d be engaged in on the weekends. I remember feeling so lost when I went to Putalisadak to fill out the entrance exam form for Trinity. But the thought of staying at KU didn’t give me any anxiety; I was excited. I loved the environment and I’d be staying with my best friends. As far as I remembered, I always had my separate room growing up. I was excited to share a room with Bijay and Karun.</p>
<p>We stayed at the Garden Hostel near 28 Killo chowk. Karun’s mom is an extra cautious type so she had insisted on staying in a hostel. Moreover, our living costs would also be less compared to staying in a room. There would be no cost for furnishing. Our hostel also provided food every day at set times, they would even give eggs and chicken on certain weekdays. This ensured a balanced diet and would be cheaper compared to eating in a hotel every day.</p>
<p>I was making all sorts of plans for my hostel life. I had already thought of how much fun I’d be having with my friends, how we’d study hard, code hard, and have so much fun at university. But I never expected how much fun I would have with other hostelers. Our hostel mostly had students from KU and most of them were our seniors. The love our seniors gave us took me by surprise. Being the only son in my family, I never had anyone that fulfilled the big brother role in my life. I didn’t interact with seniors in my school days either. The only time I remember talking properly to a senior is when I was in grade 9 and I’d be placed with a grade 10 in our internal exams. She used to ask me to solve her mathematics questions and I would ask her for help in my Nepali exam. We bonded over that but once the exams were over, that bond didn’t last much longer.</p>
<p>My seniors in the hostel were probably the friendliest and most laid-back people I have met. They started talking to us from the very first day. We played guitar, sang songs, and would pass witty jokes so we were well-liked. Our seniors would organize a “daru party” from time to time where all of us would sit together drinking vodka, sharing love stories, teasing each other, and just having fun. Having seniors also meant we could ask any university-related questions. We could make more sense of how tests and exams would be held, how different professors taught, important course topics, and so on. During our board exams, everyone in the hostel would be studying so that set a good vibe for working hard ourselves.</p>
<p>The most nonchalant among our seniors was Biraz dai. It was so much fun to play ludo or FIFA or any other games with him. Our room would be filled with a merry aura as soon as he entered. He was a big dude with a dark complexion and was extremely comfortable with himself. Over the years, he got more and more fat. I used to tease him saying that he is starting to look more and more like a black bull. He used to say I looked more and more like a rat every day. We also called him by his nickname, “Balae dai”. I don’t even remember why we called him that but that would get on his nerves. Watching an otherwise unbothered guy getting annoyed was amusing to me. We used to tease each other a lot but never with a demeaning or disrespectful tone. There would still be love and respect present in those seemingly hurtful remarks. Weirdly, his insults made me more confident in myself.</p>
<p>I was never into football but Balae dai, Karun, and Bishal supported their clubs religiously. Watching them defend their own club even in defeats and mock each other’s club was immensely entertaining. Them playing FIFA to predict today’s match score and placing bets was comical. It made me want to start watching football too, but I could never make it to the full 90 minutes without wanting to jump out the window.</p>
<p>There was also Saroj dai who actually played football. He played for KU’s football team. He, however, was not as religiously into a club as the other guys. He watched football for the game it was. I respected this quality of his. A funny thing about Saroj dai is that he didn’t know my name even after over a year of talking to each other. Everyone used to call me by my surname “Pandey” including my friends, seniors, and even hostel wardens. One day he saw I was wearing our batch’s jersey that had “Prabhat” on its back. Looking at that finally raised the question of what my real name was in his mind. After all those years, he embarrassingly asked for my real name.</p>
<p>Sagun dai and Sachin dai were a batch seniors than us who were also enrolled in the same program as us. They were always together and felt like some character from a good cop bad cop movie. Sagun dai was the huge, serious, no-joke type while Sachin dai was the small jovial, witty one who always had a rebuttal ready for everything. They made quite the pair. Being able to talk to seniors who also studied the same courses as us was awesome. We could bitch about how horrible some professors were, how useless some courses were and how unmanaged the department was. It was almost therapeutic. They gave us notes and assignments. Sagun dai shared a google drive folder with study materials and would give advice for internals and boards. All this felt like getting cheat codes to a game. We also shared lots of anime recommendations and played counterstrike together. This sparked our interest in games which was later further fueled after meeting Jason and Bishant.</p>
<p>Pradhoon dai used to sing and write songs like us. He lived on the second floor, the same floor as us and he would hum songs as he walked up the stairs. That was his theme music. It would alert us that Pradhoon dai had returned from his classes. Pradhoon dai was a batch senior to us and was quite lazy. His pastimes were sleeping, watching movies, anime, and playing mobile games. He had a hidden talent though, he gave the best nicknames. He called Karun “Karun Condo” and I think Karun should change his surname from Shrestha to Condo. It just suits him so well. He was also the one who started calling Biraj dai “Balae dai”.</p>
<p>Pradhoon dai shared his room with Bishal, or “Bishal Paji”, as he called him. Bishal was in the same batch as us, studying electrical engineering and he was the loudest, noisiest, and the most annoying guy in our hostel. The three of us always stayed up until late at night; sometimes waking up until 2 or 3 am. Bishal would wake up at 6 in the morning and knock on our door with such force you’d think the FBI is asking you to open it. If one of us didn’t get up to open the door, it’d probably break. This always woke me up but I would still not open the door. Bishal wouldn’t stop though. A normal person would think everyone is sleeping inside and stop banging the damn door. But nope, Bishal is not normal! He would keep going on and on like a broken alarm. Eventually, Karun would wake up and open the door. I wished I was like Bijay because, through all this, he would still be snoring.</p>
<p>Nabin dai is one of my closest seniors. Our rooms were right next to each other. He set an example for how our lifestyle should have been in the hostel. Our room would have fungus-filled clothes, books, and pieces of torn pages scattered all over the floor. His room had a sparkling clean floor, all his books piled up and organized based on categories, and all his clothes hung on the hanger or neatly folded and put in a bag. Our bedsheets would never be properly tucked under the mattress, and our blankets never folded. It would never be short of bits of paper, dried-out pieces of mud, pencil and eraser dust, books, copies, pens, changed clothes, and phone chargers. It felt like sleeping on a cactus field. On the other hand, looking at his bed felt like a beautiful lady seductively calling you to slowly lay down over her and go to a long, deep sleep. We would wake up at 8 in the morning and quarrel among ourselves on whose turn it was to fill water bottles for that day. He would wake up at 5 in the morning and fill 4 water bottles, boil them and drink coffee.</p>
<p>Nabin dai was studying for a diploma in electrical engineering from the Nepal Banepa Polytechnic Institute. He was incredible at practical knowledge and fieldwork but couldn’t remember all the theories. I could tell that given enough time, he would excel to new heights. If he was taught in a practical first approach and given enough room for exploration, he had the potential to be the best of the best in his field. But sadly, our education system is not suited for students of his type. Moreover, he came from a social class that could not afford to tolerate delayed success. He would soon be faced with the burdens of being the man of his house and never get to realize his true potential. This is heartbreaking to me.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-3classes">Chapter 3: Classes</h3>
<p>The three of us would always be late for our class regardless if it started at 9 am or 12 pm. Us being late had a pattern; we would be about 15 minutes late per hour of class. For a 3 credit course that used to have 2 hours of continuous lecture, we’d be about 30 minutes late. In the beginning semesters, our professors used to give us a hard time for being late. Every morning we would rush to the class, stop outside the door, and debate amongst ourselves on who would be the first one to enter. One of us would cook up a reason for being late, knock on the door and the rest would follow. This one day, we were almost 35 minutes late for our calculus class. This time, I was the first one to enter and didn’t have a lie ready in my head. As we entered, sir got us to come in front of the class and asked me why we were late. I nervously made a hand gesture as if I was eating something and said, “Sir, khana”. For the next month or so, the rest of the class called the three of us “The Khanas.” We used to blame Bijay for being late because he used to wake up late but looking back, it must have been fate because on every rare occasion when we were on time, our professor would either be late or not come at all. As time went on, our professors got used to us being late. They expected a group of three to interrupt them in the middle of the class and head straight to the last bench.</p>
<p>Giving attention in class was more challenging than understanding what was being taught. Once I understood the current topic, I would just lose my patience to wait until the teacher started the next topic. I always wished there was a fast-forward button I could press on teachers. Looking at my friends would give me peace because they were just like me. We would rarely focus; usually playing mobile games, writing our own anime stories, copying assignments, reading medium articles, or just talking to each other.</p>
<p>Initially, I didn’t have a fixed seat. I’d sit with one person in one class and with someone else in another. I wanted to talk to as many people as possible. I tried to figure out their personalities and get to know them better. Some of us would click right away and be really good friends. Some felt like they were too focused on studies and we only became study friends. Our conversation would not go too far beyond assignments, lab reports, and exams. Some felt too serious or too reserved. Our conversation would often involve me trying to get them out of their comfort zone and them wanting to never talk to me. With some guys, it felt compelling to talk about girls. We could be talking about some complex philosophical matter but our conversation would eventually come back to girlfriends, relationships, and breakups. There was this one guy I was really close to, who was like a database for girls. You could close your eyes and point to a random girl, he would give you her name, which faculty she was from, her closest friends, relationship status, and social media handles. He would even occasionally suggest a girl that I might fancy. He was incredible. I believe he could single-handedly make Tinder flop.</p>
<p>Eventually though, I found my fixed seat. Neha and I clicked as soon as we started talking. She was a good counterpart to me. Unlike me, she focused in class, made notes, kept track of assignments and their deadlines, remembered the names of our professors, and even knew our class routine. This was good and all but the most important thing was that, like me, she enjoyed dark humor. We became best friends over suicide, murder, and rape jokes. That’s what makes our bond strong. We could talk for hours and our conversation never felt dry. So I used to sit with Neha most of the time.</p>
<p>It must be my subconscious not wanting to study but I used to lose my pen a lot. I would ask someone to lend me a spare pen and then lose that pen too. Everyone stopped lending me pens after a while. Later, Neha started giving me a pen when a class started and kept that pen with her once the class was over. I can proudly say that I never lost a pen since then; because I didn’t carry one. Eventually, I stopped carrying a copy as well. It was not like I would make notes anyway. I would just ask someone, usually Neha, to tear me a blank middle page. It was funny asking Neha for the page because she used to be extremely conservative with her pages. She said she was saving trees or something. She used to write in handwriting so small that even ants would probably need a microscope to read. Saving paper was like a fetish of her; she even wrote in the margins. It sucked because, during the exams, I had to read from that same note. Those times I wished there was a zoom button I could press on the pages.</p>
<p>Not all classes were bad though. I really enjoyed calculus, discrete mathematics, and differential equations. I also loved all the professors that taught these courses, but I might be biased due to my love for mathematics. Another class I absolutely adored was digital logic. This time my bias definitely came from my love for the teacher. Kamala ma’am was the only young female teacher we had and she was just my type; pretty and smart. I had the highest class participation of my whole uni life in digital logic. Most of the participation was me trying to flirt with her. Nonetheless, it was class participation. I studied digital logic in my free time just so that I could later flirt with ma’am. I quickly got a pretty good understanding of the whole course. While I caused her a lot of trouble, she would let my shenanigans slide. Probably because I was her favorite student, but I might be biased again.</p>
<p>While I didn’t enjoy most of the classes, the courses themselves were super interesting. Therefore I did most of my studies outside of class; by myself or with my friends. I have many fond memories of me learning different courses. To be continued…</p>

<p>Thank you for reading the whole thing! This was supposed to be the first part of what I was writing. Hope you enjoyed reading it :) I never wrote part 2. It was supposed to have more stories of how we made our own game, formed a band, simulated a working CPU, pissed in the KU fountain and many more.
